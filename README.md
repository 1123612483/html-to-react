# html2react
A lightweight library that converts raw HTML to a React DOM structure.

## Why?
I had a scenario where an HTML template was generated by a different team, yet I wanted to leverage React for the parts
I did have control over. The template basically contains something like:

```
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div data-report-id="report-1">
          <!-- A React component for report-1 -->
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        <div data-report-id="report-2">
        <!-- A React component for report-2 -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

I had to replace each `<div>` that contains a `data-report-id` attribute with an actual report, which was nothing more
than a React component.

Simply replacing the `<div>` elements with a React component would end up with multiple top-level React components
that have no common parent.

The **html2react** module solves this problem by parsing each DOM element and converting it to a React tree with one
single parent.
